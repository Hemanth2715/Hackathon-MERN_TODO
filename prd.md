Objective 
Build a full-stack Todo Task Management Web Application that allows users to sign in 
using social logins (Google, GitHub, Facebook) and manage their personal and shared 
tasks. Users should be able to perform full CRUD operations, filter tasks, and 
collaborate with others by sharing tasks. The app should support real-time updates, 
responsive design, and user-friendly UI/UX. The goal is to showcase your complete 
engineering skills—from authentication, API design, and database modeling to real
time communication, cloud deployment, and DevOps best practices.
